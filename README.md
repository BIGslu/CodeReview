# CodeReview

To submit a script for review

1. Create a directory with the date and a brief description like `2021.08.19_volcano.plot/`
1. Upload a *commented* script, example data, and a README describing the purpose of your code and any specific errors or help you would like
    - This is a *public* repo. Be sure to deidentify any example data before upload
    - Someone should be able to test your code without writing a single line 
    - If your script is a function, create a separate script that loads the function and tests it on the data
    - We recommend example data be uploaded as a single `.RData` object

Ways to participate in review

1. Attend a code review session during [Code Club](https://github.com/BIGslu/CodeClub)
1. Post to the BIGslu `#CodeReview` Slack channel letting us know you tested the code and any thoughts
1. Create a GitHub issue to
    - flag an error you encountered
    - suggest a feature or update
    - suggest improvements to the codes documentation, efficiency, or changes
1. Create a pull request modifying the code to address an open issue
