# CodeReview

To submit a script for review

0. If you do not have write privileges, email Kim your GitHub username to be added, kadm@uw.edu
1. Create a directory with the date and a brief description like `2021.08.19_volcano.plot/`
2. Upload a *commented* script, example data, and a README describing the purpose of your code and any specific errors or help you would like
    - Someone should be able to test your code without writing a single line 
    - If your script is a function, create a separate script that loads the function and tests it on the data
    - We recommend example data be uploaded as a single `.RData` object

Ways to participate in review

1. Post to the BIGslu `#CodeReview` Slack channel letting us know you tested the code and any thoughts
2. Create a GitHub issue to
    - flag an error you encountered
    - suggest a feature or update
    - suggest improvements to the codes documentation, efficiency, or changes
2. Create a pull request modifying the code to address an open issue
