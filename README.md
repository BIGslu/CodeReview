# CodeReview

### To submit a script for review

1. Create a directory named with the date and a brief description like `2021.08.19_volcano.plot/`
1. Upload a *commented* script and example data
    - This is a *public* repo. Be sure to deidentify data before upload
    - If your main code for review is a function, put the function in its own script and create a separate script to load and run the function on example data
    - We recommend example data be uploaded as a single `.RData` object
1. Add a README describing the purpose of your code, any specific errors or help you would like, and any timeline or deadlines we should be aware of

### The review process

The moderator will assign your project to one of the following:

1. Live review session in [Code Club](https://github.com/BIGslu/CodeClub)
    - Once assigned to a date, the moderator will make a new branch such as `2021.09.02_CodeReview`
    - During your Code Club session, a designated member will take notes and make changes in this branch
    - After the session, the moderator will initiate a pull request for you to review the changes
    - You are welcome to continue the review process within this pull request until you are happy with the final code 
1. Online-only review
    - This process follows the same steps as a live session except the moderator will assign one or more members to create pull requests reviewing your code
    - This occurs asynchronously and is subject to individual member's availability

### Ways to participate in review

1. Attend a code review session during [Code Club](https://github.com/BIGslu/CodeClub)
2. Create a pull request modifying the code to address an open issue. Please name the branch with the date as in `2021.09.02_CodeReview`
3. Post to the BIGslu `#CodeReview` Slack channel letting us know you tested the code and any thoughts
4. If you don't want to edit code directly, create a GitHub issue to flag an error, suggest a feature, etc. Be sure to reference the code's directory name in your issue
